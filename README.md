# supernova

The worlds biggest zipbomb at the size of a galactic supernova. Made using golang and its exquisite goroutines. It does currently detonate at **49.39 primebytes** with 170 nested layers where one layer contains 2 levels.

# for reference

**49.39 primebytes** are equivalent to 11329650878906250000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 **megabytes**. All units after yottabyte are not standardised but are taken from here: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte. The **primebyte** is a non-standardised unit that I have created and is ment to be **1 googolbyte * 10^59** big.
